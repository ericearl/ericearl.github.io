Eric Earl is a Neuroinformaticist/Data Scientist at the NIMH Data Science and Sharing Team (full-time) and continues to support research in the DCAN Labs jointly between OHSU and UMN (in a small capacity).  He has been computer programming for academic research since 2005, having been a part of the NCRAR at the Portland VA Hospital, the OHSU Biomedical Engineering Department, the OHSU Advanced Imaging Research Center, and the Oregon National Primate Research Center.  He also co-invented the MRI motion monitoring software, FIRMM.

Eric's professional interests are in improving data workflows for accessibility, managing data-heavy projects with an eye for efficient solutions, and generalizing software solutions by leveraging existent tools.  In his past role as Research Associate and Computing Team Lead in the DCAN Labs he led the team to create a set of complete image processing pipelines to process fMRI sessions using the BIDS standard and BIDS App format.  This proud work was also [open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/DCAN-Labs) and [released on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dcanlabs) as well as getting a [DOI on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2605698) for each derivative pipeline.  The abcd-hcp-pipeline was also used to process 10,000+ MRI sessions from the ABCD Study and 100+ Terabytes of derivative data from this work are shared on the [NIMH Data Archive Collection 3165](https://nda.nih.gov/edit_collection.html?id=3165), fully documented on [ReadTheDocs](https://collection3165.readthedocs.io/).

You can find publications to which he has contributed in the Google Scholar link to the left.  Please feel welcome to say hello over email anytime.
